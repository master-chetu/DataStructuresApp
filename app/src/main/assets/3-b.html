<h3>
1. Explain binary tree traversal techniques with examples. (Understand)
<h3>2. Translate the given infix expression (A-B)*(D/E) into its equivalent post fix expression and construct the expression Tree. (Apply)
<h3>
3. Translate infix expression (A+B^D)/(EF)+G into its equivalent post fix expression and construct the expression Tree: (Apply)
<h3>
4. Define BST. Explain all operations of BST in detail. (Remember)
<h3>
5. Create a BST for the values 10, 30, 40, 20, 50, 80, 60, 70, 90, 100. Perform BST traversal on created tree. Also after creating the tree 
delete the values 20 and 10. (Apply)
<h3>
6. Construct a binary search tree using the following traversal input of a BST (Apply).
<ul>
<Li>1. Inorder traversal: B F G H P R S T W Y Z
<li>2. Preorder traversal: P F B H G S R Y T W Z.
(Hint from preorder, first element is root and in inorder left of P is in left subtree and remaining in right subtree. Similarly for other elements also).
</ul>
