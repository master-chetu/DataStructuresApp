<h3>1. Define Graph. (Remember)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A graph G = (V, E) consists of a set of vertices, V, and a set of edges, E.
    <li>Each edge is a pair (v,w), where v,w are vertices. Edges are sometimes referred to as arcs.
    <li>If the pair is ordered, then the graph is directed. Directed graphs are sometimes referred to as digraphs.

</ul>
<h3>2. Write down the applications of graphs. (Remember)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Traveling Salesman Problem
    <Li>Finding shortest path in communication networks
    <li>Traffic Network Design
    <li>Assignment Problems
    <li>Scheduling Problems
    <li>DNA sequencing
    <li>Dominating Sets
</ul>
<h3>3. Define following Terms: (Remember)</h3>
<ul>
    <Li>Loop : An edge from a node to itself (v,v) is called loop
    <li>Edge:It is a pair (v,w), where v,w are vertices and there exist a line from vertex v to vertex w in the given graph. Edges are sometimes referred to as arcs
    <li>Path:A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices w1, w2, w3, . . . ,wnsuch that (wi, wi+1) Є E (set of edges in the graph) for 1<= i< n. The length of such a path is the number of edges on the path, which is equal to n – 1.
    <li>Adjacency:Vertex w is adjacent to v if and only if (v,w)ЄE. In an undirected graph with edge (v,w), w is adjacent to v and v is adjacent to w
    <li>Cycle:A cycle in a directed graph is a path of length at least 1 such thatv1= vn. That is the path starts and ends at same node.

    <li>Directed graph: A directed graph/digraph is an ordered pair G = (V, A) where V is a set whose elements are called vertices, nodes, or points; A is a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arrows or directed edges. To state simply, a digraph is a graph where the edges have a direction associated with them.
    <li>Undirected Graph:All edges in an undirected graph have no directions and hence the edges are bidirectional.
    <li>Weighted Graph: A weighted graph is a graph in which a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge. Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand.
    <li>Acyclic Graph: A graph that has no cycles is called acyclic graph. In case of directed graph, there are no cycles then it is called DAG-Directed Acyclic graph.
    <li>In degree: The in degree of a vertex is the number of arcs leading to that vertex and pointed towards that vertex.
    <Li>Out degree: The outdegree of a vertex is the number of arcs leading away from that vertex.
    <li>Degree: The degree of a vertex of a graph is the number of edges incident to the vertex with loops counted twice.
