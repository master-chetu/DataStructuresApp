<h3>
1. Define Tree.</h3>
<ul>
<li>A tree is a collection of nodesn nodes, one of which is the root, and n - 1 edges.
<li>That is there are n - 1 edges which follows from the fact that each edge connects some node to its parent, and every node except the root has one parent
<li>The collection can also be empty, which is sometimes denoted as A.
<li>Otherwise, a tree consists of a distinguished node r, called the root, and zero or more (sub)trees T1 , T2 , . . . , Tk , each of whose roots are connected by a directed edge to r.
<li>The root of each subtree is said to be a child of r, and r is the parent of each subtree root.
<li>That is there are n - 1 edges which follows from the fact that each edge connects some node to its parent, and every node except the root has one parent
</ul>

<h3>
2.Define the following terms? (Give example for every definition in exams)
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leaf - Nodes with no children are known as leaves
<li>Siblings - Nodes with the same parent are siblings
<li>Path - A path from node n1 to nk is defined as a sequence of nodes n1 , n2, .. . , nk such that ni is the parent of ni+1 for 1<= i< k.
<li>Length – length of a path is the number of edges on the path.
<li>Depth - length of the unique path from the root to ni ; root is at depth 0.
<li>Height – Height of a node ni is the longest path from ni to a leaf; So, all leaves are at height 0.
<li>Degree –The number of children of a node
<li>Ancestor and descendant - If there is a path from node n1 to n2, then n1 is the ancestor of n2 and n2 is the descendant of n1.

<h3>
15. Define binary search tree?
</h3>
<ul>
<li>A binary search tree is a special binary tree, which is either empty or it should satisfy the following characteristics:
<li>Every node has a value and no two nodes should have the same value. It means the values in the binary search tree are distinct
<li>The values in any left sub-tree is less than the value of its parent node
<li>The values in any right sub-tree is greater than the value of its parent node
<li>The left and right sub-trees of each node are again binary search trees

</ul>
<img src="3-3.png" style="width:300px;height:250px;margin-left:20px">
<h3>
16. Why it is said that searching a node in a binary search tree is efficient than in simple binary tree?
</h3>
<ul>
<li>In binary search tree, the nodes are arranged in such a way that all nodes in left subtree have values less than root value and similarly all nodes in right subtree have values greater than root value.
<li>While searching for any node value,it will be compared with the parent node and accordingly either left subbranch or right sub branch will be searched.
<li>So, search is restricted to one of the subtree at every level and this makes search efficient compared to binary node in which all nodes should be compared since a match is found.
</ul>
<h3>
17. There are 8, 15, 13, 14 nodes in 4 different trees. Which of them could form a full binary tree?
</h3>
<ul>
<p>Ans: 15
<li>Reason : In general, there are 2n-1 nodes in a full binary tree. By the method of elimination, fullbinary trees contain odd number of nodes. So there cannot be full binary trees with 8 or 14 nodes. With 13 nodes, one can form a complete binary tree but not a full binary tree. So the correct answer is 15.
</ul>

<h3>26. What is a balance factor in binary tree?</h3>

<ul>
<li>1. Number of keys (max - m-1) in each non-leaf node is one less than the number of its children (max - m) and these keys partition the keys in the children in the fashion of a search tree
<li>2. All leaves are on the same level
<li>3. All non-leaf nodes except the root have at least
<li>4. The root is either a leaf node, or it has from two to m children
<li>5. A leaf node contains no more than m - 1 keys
