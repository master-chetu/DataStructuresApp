<h3>1.1 Role of Algorithms</h3>
<p>
An algorithm is
<ul>
<li>A sequence of computational steps that transform input into output.</li>
<li>Any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. </li>
<li>Describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship</li>
<li>Correct if for every input instance, it halts with correct output.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>1.1.1 Some Well-known Computational Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sorting, Searching, Shortest paths in a graph</li>
<li>Minimum spanning tree, Primality testing, Traveling salesman problem</li>
<li>Knapsack problem, Chess, Towers of Hanoi, Program termination</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>1.1.2 Example : Sorting Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>Input :  A sequence of n numbers (a1,a2,a3 ..., an)</li>
<li>Output : A permutation (a1,a2,a3,...an) of the input sequnce such that a1<a2<….an.</li>
<li>Example : Input : (31,41,59,26,41,58) - instance</li>
<li>                  Output : (26,31,41,41,58,59) - solution</li>
</ul>


<h3>1.1.3 Efficient Sorting algorithm depends on</h3>
<ul>
<li>Number of items to be sorted</li>
<li>Extent to which items are already somewhat sorted</li>
<li>Possible restrictions on item values</li>
<li>Architecture of computer</li>
<li>Kind of storage devices to be used : main memory, disk , tapes</li>
</ul>


<h3>1.1.4 Applications of Algorithms</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Human Genome Project – Algorithms to identify all the 100,000 genes in human DNA, 
determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA,
store this information in databases, and developing tools for data analysis.</li>

<li>Internet – Fast Access and retrieve large data
To find good routes for data travel
using a search engine to quickly find pages on which particular information resides</li>

<li>Elecctronic Commerce  - Needs
public-key cryptography and digital signatures which are based on numerical algorithms  and number theory.</li>

<li>Manufacturing and other commercial enterprises data
oil company -  wish to know whereto place its wells in order to maximize its expected profit. 
political candidate - want to determine where to spend money buying campaign advertising in order to maximize the chances of winning an election. </li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.5 Characteristics of Algorithms</h3>
<p>
There may be many candidate solutions but finding one that does, or one that is “best,” can present quite a challenge.
<br>
They have practical applications – For example consider shortest path algorithm. There are variety of applications like 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Trucking/ railroad company, has a financial interest in finding shortest paths through a road or rail because shorter paths results in lower labor and fuel costs.</li>
<li>Routing node on the Internet may need to find the shortest path through the network in order to route a message quickly.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Problems for which no efficient solution is known as Np complete Problems.
</p>

<h3>1.1.6 Interesting Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>No body has ever proven that  an efficient algorithm for one cannot exist.</li>
<li>If an efficient algorithm exists for any one of them, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them.</li>
<li>Several NP-complete problems are similar, but not identical, to problems for which we do know of efficient algorithms.</li>
<li>Ex : Traveling Salesman Problem</li>
</ul>
