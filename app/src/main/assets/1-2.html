<h3>1.2.1 Algorithms as a technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Computers may be fast, but they are not infinitely fast.</li>
<li>Memory may be inexpensive, but it is not free.</li>
<li>Computing time is therefore a bounded resource, and so is space in memory.</li> 
<li >We should use these resources wisely, and algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space will help us do so.</li>
<li>So, We should know  how to measure the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Time complexity</h3>
<ul> 
<li>Quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the input. The time complexity of an algorithm is commonly expressed using big O notation.</li>
<li>Is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, where an elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform.Â </li>
</ul>

<h3>Space complexity</h3>
<ul> 
<li>A measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs with respect to the input size.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2.2 Asymptotic Notations</h3>
<p>
Asymptotic Notations are languages that allow us to analyze an algorithm's running time by identifying its behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases. 
<br>
This is also known as an algorithm's growth rate.
<br>
The time required by an algorithm falls under three types -
<ul> 
<li>Best Case - Minimum time required for program execution.</li>
<li>Average Case - Average time required for program execution.</li>
<li>Worst Case - Maximum time required for program execution.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Upper Bounds: Big-Oh Notation (O)
<li>Formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.</li>
<li>It measures the worst case time complexity or the longest amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.</li>
</p>
<p>
Lower Bounds: Omega - &Omega;
<li>Formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time.</li>
<li>It measures the best case time complexity or the best amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.</li>
</p>
<p>
Tight Bounds: Theta - &Theta;
<li>Formal way to express both the lower bound and the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.</li>
</p>

<h3>Asymptotic Notations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Constant - O(1)</li>
<li>Logarithmic - O(log n)</li>
<li>Linear - O(n)
<li>n log n - O(n log n)
<li>Quadratic - O(n<sup>2</sup>)
<li>Cubic - O(n<sup>3</sup>)
<li>Polynomial - n<sup>O(1)</sup>
<li>Exponential	- 2<sup>O(n)</sup>
</ul>
