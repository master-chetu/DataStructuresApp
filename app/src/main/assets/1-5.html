<h3>1.5 Recursive definition and processes</h3>
<p>
In general, Recursion is a method of defining a function in terms of its own definition. In programming, recursion is a call to the same method from a method.
<br>
<h3>1.5 Definition:</h3>
<p>
A recursive function is defined as a function that calls itself to solve a smaller version of its task until a final call is made which does not require a call to itself.  Every recursive function has two major cases, they are,
<li>Base Case: The problem is simple and can be solved directly without making further calls to same function.</li>
<li>Recursive Case :<br>
	 i) Given problem is divided in to simpler sub parts<br> 
	ii) Function calls itself with subparts of the problem obtained in first step.<br> 
	iii)  Result is obtained by combining solutions of simpler subparts.</li>
<p>
Base case acts as the terminating condition. If it is not defined, then recursive function will generate infinite sequence of calls and will lead to error conditions. 
<br>
Example: Factorial of a given number is defined as follows.
	<br>
	For any integer n, 	n! = n * (n-1)!    (Recursive case) and also <br>
				 1! = 1  (Base Case)<br>
Therefore 5! = 5 *4!; <br>	4! = 4*3!; <br> 3! = 3 * 2!; <br> 2! = 2 * 1!; <br> 1! = 1 <br>
</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recursive solution is shorter and simpler than non-recursive ones.</li>
<li>It is a method to  solve problems by solving easier instance of the same problem</li>
<li>Code is clearer and easier to use.</li>
<li>It follows divide and conquer strategy to solve problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, recursive solutions takes more memory and time to execute</li>
<li>Difficult to find bugs if global variables are used in recursive functions</li>
</ul>
